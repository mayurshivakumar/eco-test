# Notes

## Time spent around 2.5 hours. 

## Tasks 
1) Develop ActiveRecord models for our data. --- > Completed.

2) Develop a page that is rendered at /products that shows a table view of your products. Using query parameters, a user should be able to define ordering (by category, SKU or price), or filter by category.  ----> Not done. 

3) Add a display page at /orders/:id that shows an invoice with products in order and total price. -> done. 

4) Added shopping cart for extra credit!!!! . Seemed more fun than query parameters in 2
